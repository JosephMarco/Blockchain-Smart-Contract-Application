# Solidity_simple_storage
Application in solidity that allows us to store information on a blockchain for us

Remix IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/
For deployment of application and SOL code I am leveraging a JavaScript VM per Remix IDE. This will simulate a deployment to a real network.

1) First thing you EVER need in any solidity program is the solidity version. This will always be at the top of the solidity code
2) Hitting CTRL S on windows or CMD S on mac will automatically compile the code for us
3) For this I am using version 0.6.6

Solidity Compiler tab: compiles solidity code into machine understandable language. We can choose compiler version, language, EVM version, etc..
